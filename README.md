# kidney_patients_Classification
In this repository, I am working on kidney cancer patients' data with 5 unbalanced labels. These codes are contained of Normalization, Oversampling on Feature Engineering part. A list of 9 ordinary  Machine Learning methods is provided which are used for the classification task. Then, I take advantage of two kinds of ensemble methods of hard voting and weighted voting methods. 10-fold CV has is exploited to validate results.
methods = ['Support Vector Machine', 'Logistic Regression', 'K Neighbors Classifier', 'Random Forest', \
          'Gaussian Naive Bayes', 'Linear Discriminant Analysis', 'Decision Tree', 'Gradient Boosting',\
          'soft_VotingClassifier','hard_VotingClassifier']
